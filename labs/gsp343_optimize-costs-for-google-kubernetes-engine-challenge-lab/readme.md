# [Optimize Costs for Google Kubernetes Engine: Challenge Lab ](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/16327?parent=catalog)

## Topics tested:

In this challenge lab you will be assessed on your knowledge of the following areas:
* Deploying an app on a multi-tenant cluster
* Migrating cluster workloads to an optimized node pool
* Rolling out an application update while maintaining cluster availability
* Cluster and pod autoscaling

## Challenge scenario

You are the lead Google Kubernetes Engine admin on a team that manages the online shop for OnlineBoutique.

You are ready to deploy your team's site to Google Kubernetes Engine but you are still looking for ways to make sure that you're able to keep costs down and performance up.

You will be responsible for deploying the OnlineBoutique app to GKE and making some configuration changes that have been recommended for cost optimization.

Here are some guidelines you've been requested to follow when deploying:
* Create the cluster in the us-central1 region
* The naming scheme is team-resource, e.g. a cluster could be named onlineboutique-cluster
* For your initial cluster, start with machine size n1-standard-2 (2 vCPU, 8G memory)
