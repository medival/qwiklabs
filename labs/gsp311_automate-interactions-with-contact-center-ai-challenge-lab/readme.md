## Challenge Scenario

Your company is ready to launch a new marketing campaign. For that, they would like to know what customers have been calling customer service about and what is the sentiment around those topics. They will be sending the data to a third-party for further analysis, so sensitive data such as customer's name, phone number, address, email, SSN, should all be redacted from the data. Right now all the data that they have is available as call recordings and they have not been processed/analyzed yet.
