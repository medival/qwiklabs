# [Build Interactive Apps with Google Assistant: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/11881?parent=catalog)

## Topics tested:

* Creating an Actions project
* Setup Dialogflow
* Configure Dialogflow intents
* Use a webhook in a Dialogflow intent
* Adding code to the right place to call the Google Translate API

## Challenge scenario

As a junior developer in Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Dialogflow you have been asked to help a new team (Taniwha) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks so donâ€™t expect step-by-step guides.
