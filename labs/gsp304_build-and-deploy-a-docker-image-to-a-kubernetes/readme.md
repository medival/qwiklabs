# [Build and Deploy a Docker Image to a Kubernetes Cluster](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1738?parent=catalog)

## Topics tested

* Build and tag a Docker Image of a sample application
* Push the tagged image to Container Registry
* Create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster


## Challenge scenario

Your development team is interested in adopting a containerized microservices approach to application architecture. You need to test a sample application they have provided for you to make sure that that it can be deployed to a Google Kubernetes container. The development group provided a simple Go application called echo-web with a Dockerfile and the associated context that allows you to build a Docker image immediately.
