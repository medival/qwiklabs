# [Monitor and Log with Google Cloud Operations Suite: Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/13786?parent=catalog)

## Topics tested:

* Initialize Cloud Monitoring.
* Configure a Compute Engine application for Cloud Operations Monitoring custom metrics.
* Create a custom metric using Cloud Operations logging events.
* Add custom metrics to a Cloud Monitoring Dashboard.
* Create a Cloud Operations alert.

## Challenge scenario

In your new role as Junior Cloud Engineer for Jooli Inc., you're expected to help manage the Cloud infrastructure components and support the video operations team. Common tasks include monitoring resource utilization, analyzing logs, configuring alerts, and reporting on any issues related to Jooli Inc.'s online services.

As you're expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, step-by-step guides are not provided.

Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

* Create all resources in the `us-east1` region and `us-east1-b` zone, unless otherwise directed.
* Naming is *team-resource*, e.g. an instance could be named **video-webserver1**.
* Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. Unless directed, use `n1-standard-1.`
