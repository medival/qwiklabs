# [Create and Manage Cloud Resources: Challenge Lab ](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10258?parent=catalog)

## Overview

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the labs in the [Create and Manage Cloud Resources](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/120) quest. Be sure to review those labs before starting this lab. Are you ready for the challenge?

Topics tested:
* Create an instance
* Create a 3-node Kubernetes cluster and run a simple service
* Create an HTTP(s) load balancer in front of two web servers

## Challenge Scenario

You have started a new role as a Junior Cloud Engineer for Jooli, Inc. You are expected to help manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so step-by-step guides are not provided.

Some Jooli, Inc. standards you should follow:

* Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless otherwise directed.
* Naming normally uses the format team-resource; for example, an instance could be named nucleus-webserver1.
* Allocate cost-effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored, and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so plan carefully. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share: unless directed, use f1-micro for small Linux VMs, and use n1-standard-1 for Windows or other applications, such as Kubernetes nodes.
